# perl-mp3-file-meta-info-formatter
You have a list of mp3 files that are properly named but on your phone/mp4 you see only the author?
Use this script to extract the artist name and the song title from the file name.  
E.g. you have a file named

`Iron Maiden - Fear of the dark.mp3`

But in your phone you see only the "Iron Maiden" part and 3 dots?
Download the script and run it.
The program will assume the left part as the artist name and the right as the song name.
